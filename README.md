# Smart_Home_Devices_Sustainability
AI-Driven Energy Saving Advisor for Smart Homes

#Inspiration:

The growing concern about climate change and rising energy costs inspired us to create a solution that makes smart homes truly smart and sustainable. We wanted to leverage technology to help households reduce their energy consumption, lower their bills, and minimize their carbon footprint. Our goal was to create an easy-to-use platform that empowers users to make informed decisions about their smart home devices, contributing to a greener future.

#What it does:

Our Smart Home Efficiency platform analyzes data from various smart home devices to assess and optimize their energy consumption. It takes into account factors such as usage hours, energy consumption, user preferences, and malfunction incidents. The platform uses a machine learning model to predict the efficiency of the smart home setup and provides actionable recommendations to improve energy efficiency. Users can view detailed reports and insights on their energy usage, helping them make smarter choices to reduce their environmental impact.

#How we built it:

Machine Learning: Created a classification model using Python to predict smart home efficiency. Data Visualization: Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful visualizations. User interface and backend - streamlit generating suggestions - LangChain, google Palm

#Challenges we ran into:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant and high-quality data from smart home devices was time-consuming and required extensive research. Model Training: Ensuring our machine learning model was accurate and reliable involved multiple iterations and fine-tuning.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of:

High Model Accuracy: Achieving an accuracy rate of 95% with our machine learning model. User-Friendly Interface: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing platform that users can easily navigate. Comprehensive Solution: Developing a platform that not only assesses energy efficiency but also provides actionable recommendations for improvement. Personalized suggestions

#What we learned:

Data is Key: High-quality, relevant data is crucial for building effective machine learning models. User-Centric Design: Prioritizing user experience and feedback is essential for creating a successful application. Collaboration: Working as a team and leveraging each member's strengths leads to more innovative and effective solutions.
